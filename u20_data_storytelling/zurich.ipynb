    "### Problem Statement:\n",
    "**Informed Question:** How can we leverage data on dog owners in Zurich, population demographics, income levels, and household sizes across 34 neighborhoods to gain insights into dog ownership patterns, predict future trends, and provide actionable recommendations for stakeholders?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context:\n",
    "The city of Zurich is undertaking a comprehensive exploration of dog ownership dynamics within its neighborhoods. In response to a gradual shift in popularity from larger to smaller breed dogs, coupled with a notable uptick in pet dog ownership since the removal of mandatory dog training course requirements in 2017, the city aims to inform urban planning, support pet service businesses, and enhance the overall well-being of residents and their pets. The analysis focuses on uncovering spatial patterns, identifying factors influencing dog ownership, and offering predictive insights for future planning. This project seeks to understand and leverage data, providing valuable insights into dog ownership patterns across the 34 administrative districts of Zurich. It will examine the dynamic interplay between demographic factors, such as population density, household size, and income level, with the prevalence of dog ownership. The ultimate objective is to uncover trends, identify business opportunities in the pet dog services sector, and offer tailored, data-driven insights for businesses in each neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Criteria for Success:\n",
    "The project will be considered successfully completed when the predictive models consistently achieve a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) below 10% in forecasting the number of dog owners in Zurich's 34 neighborhoods from 2015 to 2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints within Solution Space:\n",
    "- **Breed Consideration:** The analysis will consider data for pure breed dogs, excluding mix breed dogs to avoid potential confusions and complexities.\n",
    "- **Temporal Constraints:** The analysis and modeling efforts are constrained to the overlapping years from 2015 due to data availability.\n",

    "- **Businesses:** Seeking insights for marketing strategies and service offerings related to pet services.\n",
    "- **Local Authorities:** Interested in enhancing the well-being of residents and their pets through informed decisions.\n",
    "- **Pet Owners**: Puppies should be able to socialize with other dogs of the same or similar breed. In Switzerland, it is recommended that dogs have contact with humans every day, and if possible, with other dogs. Additionally, it is recommended to not leave your pet dog alone for more than four hours at a time.\n",
